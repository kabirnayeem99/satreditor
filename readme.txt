SATR - a good-for-nothing text editor
------------------------------------------

satr is a learning project for me, which in future may become
a small terminal text editor. Just a hobbyist project, where I
have no intention to include any AI-assisted coding.

This editor may grow only as far as my curiosity takes it.
Also, this may have a corresponding blog documenting my journey
on some serious programming. Back to the terminal.
